Here is where I would write a bunch of text. Visit the \href{https://github.com/nick-ulle/2015-python-course}{course website}

# Everything in the `figs` directory
figs := $(wildcard figs/*)


pres.pdf : pres.tex $(figs)
    pdflatex pres.tex

Here's some random math thing.
\[
    f(x, n) = \sum_{i=1}^n x i^2 + 23x + \pi
