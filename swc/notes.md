Self-determined motivation (a consequence of values or pure interest) leads
to better longterm outcomes than controlled motivation (a consequence of
reward/punishment or perceptions of self-worth)

I don't follow this. What does it mean for actual courses I teach?

It sounds like a book I was reading "How to talk so
little kids will listen". The book talks about effective forms of praise-
ie. describe what they did, don't just say "good job".

Teachers control a number of factors related to reward or praise that
influence student motivation, such as:
- whether a task is one the student is already motivated to perform;
- whether a reward offered for a task is verbal or tangible;
- whether a reward offered for a task is expected or unexpected;
- whether praise is offered for effort, completion, or quality of
  performance; and
- whether praise or a reward occurs immediately or after a delay.3
