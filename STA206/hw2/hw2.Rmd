```{r, echo=FALSE}
setwd('~/junkyard/STA206/hw2')
women = read.table('muscle.txt')
names(women) = c('muscle', 'age')
```

The histograms of muscle and age are unsurprising. The ranges are as expected. Age appears to be roughly uniform and muscle has a bell shape.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(1, 2))
hist(women$age, xlab = 'age', main = '')
hist(women$muscle, xlab = 'muscle', main = '')
```

The relation between age and muscle appears to be linear, and it looks like muscle
mass decreases with age.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(women$age, women$muscle, xlab = 'age', ylab = 'muscle')
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
simple = lm(muscle ~ age, data=women)
summary(simple)
```
