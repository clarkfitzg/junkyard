I would like this to work with Pandoc.

```{r, fig.cap='hey dude\\label{fig:hist}'}
x = rnorm(100)
hist(x)
rug(x)
```

Here in \ref{fig:hist} we see some normal points. And here is some inline 
`r sum(1:10)` and then the length of x is `r length(x)`.

Table
---     ---     -------
A       B       C
D       E       F

Can we print a data frame in a pretty way?
$$
x = \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i
$$

```{r}
data(ChickWeight)
cw = head(ChickWeight)
cw

library(knitr)
kable(cw)
```
