# This is an undirected graph, where the nodes are the primes and the edges represent the prime concatenation property.
# The next step is to find all the fully connected subgraphs with 5 nodes.
# I wish there was an easy off the shelf implementation for this.
# Probably won't be too difficult to do the nongeneral case though.

# Is it possible to reuse this data structure?
# I think so.
# Let p0 be the candidate prime, connected to p1, ..., pn
# To see if pk can possibly be in a fully connected 5 group with p0, no, I see a better way.

# There aren't very many numbers to check.
# sum(map(length, values(pairs)))
# 18176

# All those that have fewer than 4 elements cannot be in this set.

# Suppose we represent the graph with a (sparse) matrix.
# To find the fully connected subcomponents, we just need to get the graph into a form with diagonal blocks:
# AD, where A is a permutation matrix.
