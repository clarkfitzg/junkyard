Since 1993 California approved 31/39 bonds totalling 150 billion in debt.
6/7 "housing" bonds were approved, and all of the approved ones included some special veterans benefits.
California currently has about 75 billion in debt, and an annual budget of 190 billion.
Debt to annual budget ratio: 0.4
The country has 16 trillion in debt, an annual budget of 4.1 trillion, and an annual deficit of 0.8 trillion.
Debt to annual budget ratio: 4
That's not that different from a new homeowner.

70% increase in housing funds this year compared to last year in CA state budget.

1 billion for CalVet home loan program- this will keep the program going.
This program funds itself, because borrowers make payments for years.

1.5 billion for lower end rental housing

_150 million for the Transit-Oriented Development Implementation Fund, which offers loans and grants to local governments and developers for housing projects near transit stations;_
Good idea, but reading the news it seems that it's not money that prevents new development near transportation- rather there's too much restriction on new development - it's too easy to block.
Senate Bill 35 in 2018 should make new development a little easier.

Impact: 170 million per year for 35 years.

## Background

Proposition 13. The initiative added provisions to the California Constitution that prevented the “re-assessment” of real property unless and until the property changes hands or is substantially rebuilt.

Argument against is that this is a "patch" over systemic issues partially resulting from Prop 13.

## Veterans

California has the largest population of homeless veterans in the nation, and homelessness is expected to increase over the next decade among veterans who served in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Veterans suffering from medical and mental health conditions sustained from their service are at high risk for long-term homelessness.

Current interest rate for a 30 year loan:
Calvet: 4.625
VA: 4.73
Market: 4.93

Calvet 20 year: 3.75

## My perspective

On a 30 year loan getting a rate of 4.625% rather than 4.93% translates to about a 2% savings.
That's worth 10k on a home that costs 500k- pretty good.

No prepayment penalties for the Calvet loan- good for when my wife starts working.

## Support

Everyone knows California has housing issues.
With 60% supporting, 20% opposing, we can be pretty confident it will pass.
It needed 2/3 vote in the state legislature to make it to the ballot.
All the democrats voted yes, and most of the republicans voted no.
