- The filesystem is organized in a hierarchy.
    Directories can contain other directories, or files.
- `ls -F /` the command is `ls`, `-F` is the option, aka switch, or flag, and `/` is the argument.
- getting help: `ls --help`, `man ls`
- current working directory - `pwd`
- change directory - `cd`
- orthogonality - `.` for current directory and `..` for parent directory
- absolute and relative paths

Content 1020 - 1050
Exercise 1050 - 1110

- `mkdir`
- good names for files
- mv, cp
- Can't undo `rm`

Modify the “which editor” section. Use ‘touch’ to create the text file instead of nano. 
Stop at “moving files and directories” - probably will cut the lesson in half.
