\textbf{Problem 1.}
Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space, and let $x, y, w, z \in X$.

\textbf{a)}
Prove that
\[
    d(x, y) \geq |d(x, z) - d(z, y)|.
\]

\begin{proof}

Applying the triangle inequality two times we have
\begin{align*}
    d(x, z) \leq d(x, y) + d(y, z) 
    &\implies 
    d(x, z) - d(y, z) \leq d(x, y) \\
    d(y, z) \leq d(y, x) + d(x, z)
    &\implies 
    d(y, z) - d(x, z) \leq d(y, x) = d(x, y).
\end{align*}
For $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ if $a \leq b$ and $-a \leq b$, then
$|a| \leq b$. We have shown this, so we have the result:
\[
    d(x, y) \geq |d(x, z) - d(z, y)|.
\]

\end{proof}

\textbf{b)}
Prove that
\[
    d(x, y) + d(z, w) \geq |d(x, z) - d(y, w)|.
\]

\begin{proof}

By part a) we have
\begin{align*}
   d(x, y) &\geq |d(x, z) - d(z, y)| \\
   d(z, w) &\geq |d(z, y) - d(y, w)|.
\end{align*}
Adding both sides of the above inequalities produces
\begin{align*}
   d(x, y) + d(z, w) &\geq |d(z, y) - d(y, w)| + |d(x, z) - d(z, y)| \\
                     &\geq |d(z, y) - d(y, w) + d(x, z) - d(z, y)|  \\
                     &= |d(x, z) - d(y, w)|
\end{align*}
In the second step we used that $|a| + |b| \geq |a + b|$ for $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$.
\end{proof}

\textbf{c)}
Let $(x_n)$ and $(y_n)$ be converging sequences in $X$ such that $\lim_{n
\rightarrow \infty} (x_n) = x$ and $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} (y_n) = y$.
Prove that $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} d(x_n, y_n) = d(x, y)$.

\begin{proof}
\end{proof}

\textbf{Problem 2.}
Show that the limit of a convergent sequence in a metric space is unique.
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\textbf{Problem 3.}
Let $(a_n)$ be a sequence in $\mathbb{R}$.
\textbf{a)}
There exists a subsequence of $(a_{n_k})_{k=1}^{\infty}$ of $(a_n)$
such that $lim_k a_{n_k} = \lim \inf_n a_n$.
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}

\textbf{b)}
$(a_n)$ converges to $a \in \mathbb{R}$ if and only if $\lim \inf_n a_n =
\lim \sup_n a_n = a$.

\begin{proof}
\end{proof}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\textbf{Problem 4.}
Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space.

\textbf{a)}
The empty set and the set $X$ itself are both open and closed sets in $(X,
d).$
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}

\textbf{b)}
The intersection of a finite collection of open sets is open.
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}

\textbf{c)}
The union of an arbitrary collection of open sets is open.
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}

\textbf{d)}
The union of a finite collection of closed sets is closed.
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}

\textbf{e)}
The intersection of an arbitrary collection of closed sets is closed.
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\textbf{Problem 5.}
Let $(X, d_X)$ and $(Y, d_Y)$ be metric spaces, $f: X \rightarrow Y$ a
continuous function and $B \subset Y$ a closed set. Then $A$ defined by
\[
    A = \{ x \in X | f(x) \in B \}
\]
is a closed set.
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\textbf{Problem 6.}
Let $X$ be a Banach space and let $(x_n)$ be a sequence in $X$ such that
$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} ||x_n|| = 1$.

\textbf{a)}
Prove that the series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} x_n$ also converges to a limit $x \in X$.
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}

\textbf{b)}
Prove that for an subsequence $(x_{n_k})_{k=1}^{\infty}$ of $(x_n)$, the 
series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} x_{n_k}$ also converges and that the norm of
its limit is bounded by 1.
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}
