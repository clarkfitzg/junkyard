The pattern returned for each element of bayes_mvs is important
because it is an estimate with confidence interval. 
It might be even be worth exposing this one publicly.

bayes_mvs: mean, variance, std_dev
    (center, (lower, upper)) -> estimate, minmax

describe: n, minmax, mean, variance, skewness, exc_kurtosis
mode: mode, count
sigmaclip: clipped, lower, upper
linregress: slope, intercept, rvalue, pvalue, stderr

normaltest: k2, pvalue
skewtest: zscore, pvalue
kurtosistest: zscore, pvalue
f_oneway: fvalue, pvalue

pearsonr: correlation, pvalue
spearmanr: correlation, pvalue
pointbiserialr: correlation, pvalue
kendalltau: correlation, pvalue

cumfreq: cumcount, lowerlimit, binsize, extrapoints
histogram: count, lowerlimit, binsize, extrapoints
relfreq: frequency, lowerlimit, binsize, extrapoints

binned_statistic: stat, bin_edges, binnumber
binned_statistic_2d: stat, x_edge, y_edge, binnumber
binned_statistic_2d: stat, bin_edges, binnumber
   

Not doing rv.stats because it returns variable length result
